You will be presented a conversation between a client and a digital therapist. At this stage, the digital therapist just chose which type of therapy to administer to the client. I want you to create the following message of the therapist based on the therapy chosen and the conversation.

Context:

### CONTEXT ###

Therapy type:

### THERAPY TYPE ###

Only answer with the new message from the digital therapist and nothing else (no context, no therapy type, no other text).
Please be concise, clear and simple, as some people could not understand everything related to psychotherapies but still tell which therapy is chosen!
