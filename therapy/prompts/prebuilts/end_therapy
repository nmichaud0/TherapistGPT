As your digital psychotherapist, I want to remind you of the importance of seeking professional help from a licensed mental health practitioner when needed. While I am here to provide support and guidance, my capabilities are limited compared to the expertise and personalized care that a real psychotherapist can offer.

It seems we have reached the end of our therapy session today. I encourage you to consider reaching out to a professional psychotherapist or counselor who can provide in-depth, tailored assistance for your unique situation. Remember, your mental health is a priority, and seeking help from qualified professionals is a vital step in your journey towards well-being.

Take care, and I wish you all the best in your pursuit of mental health and personal growth.
